      BACKSTORY:
    </p>
    <p>
      This song was recorded on Saturday, August 28th 2010 at the Saint Claire Recording Company in Lexington, Kentucky.
      <br />

      In order to get multiple camera angles I had the students record the song using a click track. Not only did using
      the click track help create a better video, but many professional recordings are laid down to a click track.
      <br />

      Viewers continue to wonder why the students aren't jumping around and delivering a great visual performance as
      well. Apparently no one bothers to read these video descriptions. Playing along with the click track requires a
      great deal of
      concentration, so that wouldn't possible for many musicians, especially a bunch of kids....in this case students
      ranging in age from 13 to 16. <br />
      We only had 2 hours to record and videotape this performance. In a rush we missed a very important detail. The
      intro of the song is supposed to be 2 guitars playing with a clean tone. Although we dialed back the gain on the
      amps when we
      recorded
      the intro, there was still a little bit of distortion which you can hear in the track. <br />

      The guitars were recorded with a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier and a Marshall head. The speaker cabinets were two
      4x12 Shawnee cabinets and were mic'd with a set of Royers. <br />

      We attempted to mix the song just like the original recording. All of the effects, levels, etc... are based on the
      original version. <br />

      We videotaped the performance using two Panasonic AG-HVX200 DVCPRO's. <br />
