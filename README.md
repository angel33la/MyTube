# MyTube
## This is a project for Devslopes.
### This is a mytube that I set up with three of the really great music videos from Fame On Fire, Our Last Night, and O'Keefe Music Foundations. All of which were makin songs that were originally done by other artists. All three bands have the ability to turn the genre into being a more rock and roll type of music. Check it out. Check out all 3 artists. (O'Keefe Music Foundations being ones that have different children doing these songs, they are really good)
